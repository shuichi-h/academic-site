## Model
Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC3+

## SOP

- [Standard Operating Procedure (PDF)](/academic-site/assets/pdfs/SOP_TGA_v1.pdf)

## Tips
- Keep sample trays and crucibles clean at all times.Even a small impurity on the crucible bottom can cause fusion and permanent damage.  
- Be extremely careful with metals or inorganic salts that do not decompose at high temperatures.Once they contaminate the holder, the residue cannot be removed and the damage is irreversible.  
- Remember, the crucibles are alumina.Always consider possible reactions with your sample.
- Do not overload the crucible.Use a lid if necessary.
