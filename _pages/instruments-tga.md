## Instrument
Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC3+

## SOP


## Tips
Keep sample trays and crucibles clean at all times.Even a small impurity on the crucible bottom can cause fusion and permanent damage.
Be extremely careful with metals or inorganic salts that do not decompose at high temperatures.Once they contaminate the holder, the residue cannot be removed and the damage is irreversible.
Remember, the crucibles are alumina.Always consider possible reactions with your sample.
Do not overload the crucible.Use a lid if necessary.

## Troubleshooting
**Symptom**  
TGA cannot heat up to the starting temperature (e.g. 35 °C).
Cell temperature shows an unrealistic value of 12 °C.

**Cause**  
The heating element reached the end of its expected lifetime (approximately 5 years).

**Action**  
TBD.  
Full furnace replacement planned.

**Status**  
Waiting.
